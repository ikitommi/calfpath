# Changes and TODO


## TODO

* Make URI-match work for partial matches and URI prefixes
  * A partial URI pattern may be expressed with a `*` suffix
  * Zero or more partial URI patterns may exist in a route tree
  * This may impact how URIs in HTTP-400 responses are generated
* Add support for fetching/rendering static files
  * Rendering should be configurable (default: fn that returns file-content as body)


## 0.3.0 / 2016-May-??

* Support for extensible routes as a first-class abstraction
  * A dispatcher fn that walks given routes to match request and invoke corresponding handler
  * An optimized (through loop unrolling) way to create a dispatcher fn from given routes
  * Helper fns to manipulate routes at shallow and deep levels


## 0.2.1 / 2016-February-17

* Add support for `PATCH` HTTP method


## 0.2.0 / 2015-June-06

## 0.1.0 / 2015-June-04
