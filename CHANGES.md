# Changes and TODO


## TODO

* [TODO] BREAKING CHANGE: Rename the abstraction to uri-template to path
* [TODO] Add support for fetching/rendering static files
  * Rendering should be configurable (default: fn that returns file-content as body)


## 0.4.0 / 2016-October-??

* Make URI-match work for partial matches and URI prefixes
  * A partial URI pattern may be expressed with a `*` suffix
  * Zero or more partial URI patterns may exist in a route tree
  * This may impact how URIs in HTTP-400 responses are generated
* Middleware
  * A helper fn `calfpath.route/update-in-each-route` to apply route attribute wrapper to specs
  * A lift-key middleware `calfpath.route/lift-key-middleware` to split routes with mixed specs
  * A ring-route middleware `calfpath.route/ring-handler-middleware` to wrap Ring handlers into route handlers
* Helper fn to build routes from given route specs
* Allow non-literal string URI-patterns in `calfpath.core/->uri`
* [TODO] BREAKING CHANGE: Drop `calfpath.core/make-uri-handler` in favor of Calfpath routes


## 0.3.0 / 2016-May-27

* Support for extensible routes as a first-class abstraction
  * A dispatcher fn that walks given routes to match request and invoke corresponding handler
  * An optimized (through loop unrolling) way to create a dispatcher fn from given routes
  * Helper fns to manipulate routes at shallow and deep levels


## 0.2.1 / 2016-February-17

* Add support for `PATCH` HTTP method


## 0.2.0 / 2015-June-06

* Dispatch (fn) on URI template by calling fns, that returns a Ring handler fn
